Chat transcript of a recent conversation I had with [Jai Chaudhry](https://twitter.com/JaiChaudhry)

Yogin:
> i just had a random thought
       if your screen has 11M pixels in total. and a pixel can take any one value from 0 to 255 possible.
       this means that whatver you see right now in your screen is one of the frame of 11M^256 permutations.
       11M^256  -> this number includes all the possibilities you did in past and all of the future. all the frames you are going to see is this combination
       it is nothing outside than this.
       a screen which shows skype, movies, google, texts all the text books that are not even written yet will be fitted in one of the 11M^256 frames.
       isn't that amazing?
       and this include all of the people in the planet

Jai:
> our screen has 1.5 million pixels :P

> Good thought though

Yogin:
> however even for 1M:
![Infinity!]({{ site.url }}assets/images/oneMillionPixels.png)

Jai:
> lol

Yogin:
> that is infinity!

Jai:
> hence proved you cannot beat nature :P

Yogin:
> nice proof man!

Jai:
> this conversation should be made public.

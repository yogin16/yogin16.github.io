There was a question on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3jgqjl/what_is_your_favourite_educationalinformative/) about favorite YouTube channel and it came up with quite a list of channels. Few science, few aww, few on strange topics; very informative and geeky. Here is a list of few channels I am fan of personally, with no particular order.

### [Vsauce](https://www.youtube.com/user/Vsauce)
I once mentioned Vsauce to a colleague on work and he had no idea about that. (the motivation to write this post). And he immediately became fan after watching one video.
Math and Science videos with detailed research and explanation. [Micheal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stevens_(educator)) there, always thanks you for watching those videos.

### [Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/user/Kurzgesagt)
It explains science and reality in simplified manner. It takes real and somewhat far concepts and explains with great animations with good information. Quality over quantity.

### [Nerdwriter1](https://www.youtube.com/user/Nerdwriter1)
The Nerdwriter writes (read: films) about art, philosophy and science. The guy is very passionate and dedicated for the channel and content is well researched. It asks questions first to explain the science behind them; or shows art first before understanding them with the artist's philosophy and a nerd's perspective.

### [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A)
Thinking numbers philosophically. They are quite decent with their explanation with simple and hard famous math problems. They are easy to follow but requires some math background. I learned about them in college and I had overnight YouTube marathon watching their videos. They are explorers of infinity, just like any mathematicians would merely define themselves.

### [PatrickJMT](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFe6jenM1Bc54qtBsIJGRZQ)
PatrickJMT is the maan. Simple, basic, math fundamentals. There are lots of videos for math concepts, we may not need all but it is good for home-works.

### [TheGreatWar](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheGreatWar)
They have content on war! World war I. Exploring philosophy of war.

### [Screen Junkies](https://www.youtube.com/user/screenjunkies)
Screen Junkies produces videos on films and games. Their honest trailers of famous hollywood movies are a treat to watch which filled with humour and epic narration. Just plain fun.

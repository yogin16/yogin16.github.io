Yahoo recently open-sourced their big data search engine - [Vespa](https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa). Good alternative to Elasticsearch for search store. Here are notes on our feasibility for Vespa comparing with Elasticsearch.

## Setup

### Archtecture

## Indexing

### Distribution

## Searching

### Aggregation

#### Checklist for Aggregations
- Always add max(x) in the group for size of buckets needed. When data is distributed across multiple content nodes this result can be inaccurate. To increase accuracy we need to use precision(x) as well to tune accuracy as we need.
- If you only need aggregation buckets and no hits - pass limit 0 in the yql; this will save the step to load summary to be returned for container.
- The attribute fields we are filtering/aggregating to be on mode fast-search; otherwise it is not B-tree like index - and has to be traversed.
- Ensure constant score for docs with &ranking=unranked in the query.
- Enable groupingSessionCache: http://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/reference/search-api-reference.html#groupingSessionCache
- Sizing the content node for tradeoffs of latency vs no. of docs. by max-hits as described: http://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/performance/sizing-search.html
- If memory is the bottleneck one can look at attribute flush strategy configuration. http://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/proton.html#proton-maintenance-jobs
- If CPU is the bottleneck; increase parallelism. Ensure all cores are used in Searcher. http://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/content/setup-proton-tuning.html#requestthreads-persearch. Changes for that in `service.xml`:
    `<persearch>16</persearch>`
    Threads `persearch` is by default 1.
